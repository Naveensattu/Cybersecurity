Physical address = MAC address

IPv6 - hexa decimal ( 8 groups )
IPsec encryption is mandatory to IPv6
Types - fc00:    :fd00 ( start and ends ) - private IPv6

NAT - network address translation ( to make private ip reach to internet taking advantage of public )
DHCP - dynamic host configuration protocol ( allocates IP to the system connected )


Nmap - Network mapper ( Information gathering )
Using Nmap we can identify - host discovery

Handshake - sync synck acknowledgment

Commands to check with Nmap                               - ( scanme nmap - for testing )
nmap -p 1-1023 <ipaddress/domain/text file>        - shows the ports that are open, closed and filtered
nmap -p 1-1023 -sV <ipaddress/domain>                - to show the ports that are open closed and filtered with the services running on top of port with version- 
searchsploit openssh <version>                               - to check the ecploit options
nmap -p http,https,ssh <ipaddress/domain>          - other way to check with the name of port
nmap -p 22,443 <ipaddress/domain>                      - other way
nmap -sP -v <set of ip/172.31.5.0-255>                    - to check in other way (main) -v is verbose to see in detail

nmap -PE -sn scanme.nmap.org                                - to  scan and know ip and ipv6 of the host aswell ( layer 3 sending icmp packets )                                       (tcpdump -i eth0 host <sourceip>     - to check whats happening)

nmap -iL <iplist.txt>                                                    - to scan all the ip's mentioned in file and show all open pen ports on host
nmap -sA -iL <iplist.txt>                                             - to scan and see if any filtered ports are there ( filtered is accessible butnot open ) ack scan
nmap -sU -iL <iplist.txt>                                             - to scan UDP port
nmap -sV -iL iplist.txt                                                 - to scan version of the service running on port
nmap -O -iL iplist.txt                                                  - to scan OS of service running
nmap scanme.nmap.org -T5                                      - to scan fast
nmap <ipaddress> -D RND:20                                    - to give scan from 20 source ips to destination ip to avoid detection
nmap <ip> --spoof-mac 0                                            - scan with different mac address
nmap <ip> -f                                                                - scan with fragmented ip

Active Directory : authentication, authorization & accountability

Bring up Windows server os 2022 or any
Go to server manager
Top right manage > and go with installation of AD
Top right next to manage open flag and promote to domain controller (with domain name)

To add new user - go to server manager >  tools on right top
Add user and AD
Under users - left click and new user (create user with details)
After adding right click on user got to properties > select groups > go to advanced > add to group
Open group policy management from windows search > go to domains find ours > right click default policy > create new policy (with details) - if you want t o edit again right click on the policyand edit.
In policies - ecpand & select advanced audit policy configurations and can see multiple things to monitor
Open run from windows search bar and open eventvwr.msc and can find windows logs 

LDAP - Lightweight Directory access protocol ( is a protocol to login to applications using SSO with AD )

Intrusion detection system - IDS
Intrusion prevention system - ips

Enabling RDP in Windows.

settings > system > remote desktop (enable) - in the user accounts (select users that can RDP to machine)
Open windows defender firewall > advanced security > inbound rules - Remote desktop_user mode (right click and enable) - now can RDP to this derver from other host
If want to allow only particular IP's - right click on Remote Desktop_ user mode > properties > enable connection and go to scope settings > add ip's
